## How it works?

It only works with BTC Puzzle 66, 67 and 68 (You can change the puzzle number from the **[<ins>target_puzzle</ins>]** variable in the <ins>[settings.txt](./BitcrackRandomiser/settings.txt)</ins> file.).

## Proof of Work

When requesting a range from the pool, **three wallet addresses** are also returned. The private key of these addresses is scanned simultaneously. To ensure that a range is scanned, the private key of three wallet addresses must be found. The private keys of the found addresses are hashed with SHA256. In this way, **"Proof Key"** is created. This is to make sure your program is working correctly. I also want to make sure you have a really healthy scan.

Example; pool returns `3E2ECB0` HEX range to scan. The pool randomly generates <ins>extra three private keys</ins> within the returned HEX range. `3E2ECB00000000000` and `3E2ECB0FFFFFFFFFF`. 

Marking is done with `SHA256(PROOFKEY1+PROOFKEY2+PROOFKEY3)`

<ins>**Note:** The number of proof keys can be increased/decreased dynamically by the API. By standard the total number is 3.</ins>

## Example Puzzle 66 Scenario

If you want to **scan all private keys in  puzzle 66**; you need to do 36 quintillion scans in total. In case you do a random scan; previously generated private keys will be regenerated (random problem). This extends the scan time by x10. Puzzle 66 HEX ranges as follows. It starts with 2 or 3. Any private key in this range is **17 characters long.**

`20000000000000000 to
3ffffffffffffffff`

**We take the first 7 characters** and delete the rest for now. The result will be as follows.

`2000000 to
3ffffff`

We now have about 33 million possible ranges to search. All possible ranges are **stored in the database**. A random value will come up each time a scan job is called and **will be marked as scanned** when the scan is complete. Note: Each range contains 1,1 trillion private keys.

I can scan each range in about 10 minutes on NVIDIA 3090. This actually means about 1,1 trillion private keys. When the range is scanned, it is marked as scanned. So it won't show up anymore.

For Puzzle 66: 2000000-2050000 (First ~%0.98) ranges and 3FAF000-3FFFFFF (Last ~%0.98) manually defeated in this pool. If you rescan a defeated range, it will now be marked as scanned normal.

## Example

Random range from database: **326FB80**

The program tells Bitcrack/VanitySearch to scan the following range: **326FB800000000000** / **326FB80FFFFFFFFFF** (Contains 1,1 trillion private keys)

When the range is scanned, a new range is requested and the process proceeds in this way.

# How to use?

You can read detailed [How To Use Guide](https://github.com/ilkerccom/bitcrackrandomiser/blob/main/HOW-TO-USE.md)

## Simple Using

1 - Create an account on [BTCPuzzle.info](https://btcpuzzle.info/user-center) website and obtain your user token.

2 - Download latest released [Bitcrackrandomiser](https://github.com/ilkerccom/bitcrackrandomiser/releases) or build it yourself.

3 - Download .NET 6.0 runtimes from [Microsoft](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0)

4 - Edit the <ins>[settings.txt](./BitcrackRandomiser/settings.txt)</ins> file according to you.

5 - Run the application.

## Using CloudSearch

If you're looking for the easiest way to join the pool, you're in the right place. Rent the graphics card you want at hourly rates and chase the reward. Go to [CloudSearch by btcpuzzle.info](https://btcpuzzle.info/cloud-search).

1 - Create an account on [BTCPuzzle.info](https://btcpuzzle.info/user-center) website and activate your CloudSearch account.

2 - Top up balance (USD) using Polygon, Base, ETH and many other networks.

3 - Create a template and rent the instance you want. That is all!

## Using Docker Images

You can use docker image for a faster experience. You can also create your own docker image. "[Dockerfile](./Dockerfile/Dockerfile)" is available in the repo. Visit the [Bitcrackrandomiser Docker Images](https://hub.docker.com/r/ilkercndk/bitcrackrandomiser/tags)

<ins>What needs to be done above is ready in the Docker image. All you have to do is run the application.</ins>



### # ilkercndk/bitcrackrandomiser:latest

Everything is ready! Edit the [settings.txt](./BitcrackRandomiser/settings.txt) file and run the app!

```bash
$ docker run -it ilkercndk/bitcrackrandomiser:latest
... edit settings file ...
$ dotnet BitcrackRandomiser.dll
```

Don't forget to add the `--gpus all` flag when running on your local computer.

```bash
$ docker run --gpus all -it ilkercndk/bitcrackrandomiser:latest
```

### # ilkercndk/bitcrackrandomiser:autorun

Everything is ready! When you run the image, <ins>bitcrackrandomiser</ins> starts automatically. You can see the Docker create/run settings in the example below. Does not need interactive console.

```bash
$ docker run -e BC_WALLET=xxxx -e BC_USERTOKEN=xxxx ilkercndk/bitcrackrandomiser:autorun
```

Example run Bitcrack  on Vast.ai;

```bash
$ docker run -e BC_APP_TYPE=bitcrack ilkercndk/bitcrackrandomiser:autorun
```

Example run VanitySearch on Vast.ai;

```bash
$ docker run -e BC_APP_TYPE=vanitysearch ilkercndk/bitcrackrandomiser:autorun
```

If you do not send the ```BC_APP_TYPE``` value, "vanitysearch" will run by default. You do not need to send the ```BC_GPUCOUNT``` value. The number of GPUs will automatically calculate the total number of graphics cards on the instance and the application will be run.



### Docker options with default settings

```bash
BC_PUZZLE=66
BC_USERTOKEN="0"
BC_WALLET="1eosEvvesKV6C2ka4RDNZhmepm1TLFBtw"

### [**target_puzzle**]

Select the puzzle you want to scan. Default: 66

`66` or `67` or `68`

You can use `38` for test pool. There are 32 possible ranges in the test pool. You can find the test pool data on the website. Test pool data is reset every 30 minutes.

---

### [**app_type**]

Currently only `bitcrack` and `vanitysearch` is available.

Possible Value|Description
-|-
`bitcrack`|Scan with Bitcrack
`vanitysearch`|Scan with VanitySearch

**NOTE: You can use OpenCL "clBitcrack.exe" for <ins>AMD devices on Bitcrack v0.30 only</ins>**

---

### [**app_arguments**] 

You can write the arguments for Bitcrack or VanitySearch. For default settings leave blank.

`-b 896 -t 256 -p 256` or `-t 128` or you can leave blank.

Note: Do not use `-o --keyspace` parameters.

---

### [**user_token**]

<ins>You can create user token value by logging into your account</ins> at btcpuzzle.info. If you do not have an account, you can create a new account using your wallet address.

You can revoke the user token value at any time. However, when you do this, you must also enter the new value from the workers settings file.

Example user token value;

`VDGcruTrDZ62EuJsE9IQUCiRIKRhZpXw6RPtcnk1jBxbROn1nxZixBMql8L2zxKwD9QXb1UZoWgrDf8IwciRDUHxHzwkNrDzNBpio2UdAx4rLYsjMnI887eqWGauszBl`


---

### [**wallet_address**]

Enter the BTC wallet address here. 

`1eosEvvesKV6C2ka4RDNZhmepm1TLFBtw` or `1eosEvvesKV6C2ka4RDNZhmepm1TLFBtw.worker1`

You can specify a **worker name** like `{wallet}.{worker}` Only alphanumeric is accepted. Max 16 characters. Do not use special characters. If you do not enter a worker name, it will be created automatically.

If you enter an invalid BTC address, it will show as "Unknown" in the system and you cannot follow your workers on your dashboard.

**Note: You can only enter your wallet address registered to your membership account. If you enter any other address, you will get an error.**

---

### [**gpu_count**]

Specify the number of GPUs to use. Default: 1. 

Each GPU performs a separate range scan.

If you are using more than one GPU, GPU indexes will be automatically added to the end of your worker address. Example: `{worker}_0` or `{worker}_1`

---

### [**gpu_index**]

Index number of the graphics card to be used. Use only if you are going to scan with a single graphics card.

If you have a single video card, use the value "0". If you are scanning with more than one graphics card, this field is disabled.

---

### [**gpu_seperated_range**]

Only valid for VanitySearch. By default, VanitySearch uses 1 range to scan all graphics cards. If you set this setting to "true", each GPU scans different ranges. 

In some systems with multi GPU, it works slightly better than the default setting.

You must have at least 2 GPUs to use this setting. You also need to update the "gpu_count" setting according to the number of graphics cards you have.

---

### [**scan_type**]

Select a scan type. 

Possible Value|Description
-|-
`default`|Scan anything that isn't scanned.
`includeDefeatedRanges`|Include defeated ranges. This does not scan ranges that have already been scanned!
`excludeIterated2`|Exclude iterated ranges (2 iterated and more). Not good choice. Example: 1A<ins>FF</ins>1B3 
`excludeIterated3`|Exclude iterated ranges (3 iterated and more). May be good choice. Example: 1A<ins>FFF</ins>B3
`excludeIterated4`|Exclude iterated ranges (4 iterated and more). Good choice. Example: 1A<ins>FFFF</ins>3
`excludeContains3`|Exclude contains ranges (3 and more). Not good choice. Example: 1<ins>F</ins>A1<ins>FF</ins>3
`excludeContains4`|Exclude contains ranges (4 and more). May be good choice. Example: 1<ins>F</ins>A<ins>F</ins>C<ins>FF</ins>
`excludeAlphanumericLoop`|Exclude if HEX contains only numbers or only letters. Example: <ins>2572441</ins> or <ins>BCAFFEB</ins>
`excludeEven` / `excludeOdd`|Exclude the even or odd numbered HEX range.<br/><br/>You can only choose one. When you select any of them, the number of keys to be scanned decreases by 1/2.
`excludeStartsWith{XX}`|Exclude ranges that starts with. [Min 1, max 2 chars]. <br/><br/>Example [1]: `excludeStartsWith2` The range starting with 2 will not return.<br/>Example [2]: `excludeStartsWith2A` The range starting with 2A will not return.<br/><br/>If you enter a value that you entered in the "**custom_range**" field, you will get a "reached of keyspace" error and the application will be stopped.

You can make multiple settings using commas.

```
...
scan_type=excludeIterated3,excludeStartsWith2A,excludeStartsWith2B,excludeStartsWith3F
...
```

---

### [**scan_rewards**]

`true` or `false`

It scans "pool rewards" addresses in addition to the target wallet address. If it finds the reward key it just creates a new text file and sends notification via telegram or api_share.

Even if the reward is found, the application continues to operate normally. The reward found can only be claimed by the person who scans the range where the private key is located.


Click for detailed **"[reward creation and claiming](https://btcpuzzle.info/reward.pdf)"**  diagram in PDF.

---

### [**custom_range**]

Scan custom range

`none` Scan all of ranges.

`2D` or `3BA` or `3FF1`  Enter the first [2-5] characters of the range you want to scan. Only one value.

You can use specify ranges like `3400000:38FFFFF`. Incoming keys will be selected from this range. You must write the range in full length. Make sure you enter the correct range.

You can use percentiles like `%5:%20`. In the example, only HEX values between 5% and 20% will be scanned.

Note: You can specify only one setting for the custom range field.

---

### [**api_share**]

`none` or `https://{your_api_url}`

Receive the all actions as a POST request to your own server. All values are requested as "header". Below you can see what data is coming.

IMPORTANT: If the key is found and an unsuccessful result is received from the API (body), it makes a unlimited attempts.

```C
status // [workerStarted, workerExited, rangeScanned, reachedOfKeySpace, keyFound]
hex // Scanned HEX value
privatekey // Private key if that found
targetpuzzle // Which puzzle is being scanned [66,67,68 or 38]
workeraddress // Worker wallet address [1eosEvvesKV6C2ka4RDNZhmepm1TLFBtw]
workername // Worker name [worker1039]
scantype // Current scan type [default, includeDefeatedRanges]
```

I wrote a sample PHP script to get the data. It sends info to Telegram.

```php
<?php
$headers = getallheaders();
$status = $headers['Status'];
$hex = $headers['Hex'];
$workeraddress = $headers['Workeraddress'];
$workername = $headers['Workername'];
$privatekey = $headers['Privatekey'];
$scantype = $headers['Scantype'];
$targetpuzzle = $headers['Targetpuzzle'];

if($status == "workerStarted"){
	shareTelegram($workeraddress.$workername." started job!");
}
else if($status == "workerExited"){
	shareTelegram($workeraddress.$workername." goes offline!");
}
else if($status == "rangeScanned"){
	shareTelegram($hex." scanned by ".$workeraddress.$workername);
}
else if($status == "reachedOfKeySpace"){
	shareTelegram($workeraddress.$workername." reached of keyspace!");
}
else if($status == "keyFound"){
	shareTelegram("Congratulations! ".$workeraddress.$workername." found the key! Key is: ".$privatekey);
}
function shareTelegram($message){
	$apiToken = "{telegram_api_token}";
	$chatId= "{telegram_chat_id}";
	$data = [ 
	 "chat_id" => $chatId, 
	 "text" => $message
	]; 
	$response = file_get_contents("http://api.telegram.org/bot$apiToken/sendMessage?" . http_build_query($data) ); 
}

echo 'true';

?>
```

You must return `true` as a result from the API. The returned value is checked only when the key is found and new requests are sent until it receives a 'true' response from the API (Unlimited attempts).

### [**telegram_share**]

Share progress to Telegram

`true` Share progress to Telegram. 

`false` If false, it does not send notification. 

It sends a notification to Telegram when the private key is found. If you set "**telegram_share_eachkey**" to "true", it will send notification every time the scan is finished.

If your Telegram settings are correct, you will receive a notification that the worker has started working.

Suggestion: If you are on an untrusted computer, make the settings via the console and proceed without saving.

IMPORTANT: If the key is found and Telegram cannot transmit the key to you, it will make  unlimited attempts.

---

### [**telegram_acesstoken**]

Enter Telegram BOT access token

Example: 6331494066:ABEfv4cF3dbc3mA8qGLDlEp2uxzgYESIa_w

---

### [**telegram_chatid**]

Enter Telegram chat id

Example: -9334716240

---

### [**telegram_share_eachkey**]

`true` Send notification each key scanned.

`false` It only sends a notification when the private key is found.

---

### [**untrusted_computer**]

Leave true if you are working on an untrusted computer

`true` When private key is found, <ins>**it only sends it via Telegram or API share**</ins>. Make sure your Telegram settings are correct. <ins>Otherwise, when the key is found, you will not be able to see it anywhere.</ins>

`false` When private key is found, The private key will be <ins>saved in a new text file</ins> and it <ins>appears on console screen</ins>. If Telegram share is active, notification will be sent.



---

### [**test_mode**] 

Start app in test mode if `true`. You can test with custom parameters by creating a "**customtest.txt**" file in the app root folder.

```C
1Cnrx6rxiGvVNw1UroYM5hRjVvqPnWC7fR // [TargetAddress]
2012E83 // [HexStart]
2012E84 // [HexEnd]
```

<ins>[TargetAddress]</ins> The private key you want to find

<ins>[HexStart]</ins> HEX range to start scanning

<ins>[HexEnd]</ins> HEX range to stop scanning


---

### [**force_continue**] 

`true` If the private key is found, the scan will continue until it is finished. The related range is marked as "scanned" (like others). The scanned range will never be scanned by another user again. Telegram or api share feature must be active or insecure computer feature must be false. Because the scan will continue, the private key will not appear on the console screen.

`false` If the private key is found, the scanning process is terminated. No data is sent to the pool. It can be scanned again by another user after 12 hours (even with very low probability).

---

### [**private_pool**] 

`none` or `{private_pool_id}`

You can create your own pool for Puzzle 66, 67 and 68. Only the user who created this pool can use it and no other user can join.

Private pools use a database other than the main pool. That's why it's completely empty. Ranges scanned in the private pool just stay there. It is not transferred to another pool.

Private pools can be created. You can reach me via Telegram for create your own puzzle pool.

### [**enable_logging**]

`true` or `false`.

Stores error and information messages in a text file. Logging is disabled by default.

## Tips

1. If you are working on someone else's computer, set "untrusted_computer" to "true". However, you need to change either "api_share" or "telegram_share" to "true".
2. If possible, use "api_share" instead of "telegram_share". So you can save the private key in a file, send it via SMS or send it as mail.
3. Set "app_arguments" according to GPU model. This will give you higher performance.
4. I recommend using at least the "excludeIterated4" type in the scan type. It is very unlikely that such a private key will occur with hierarchically generated private keys.
5. If you are scanning with more than one video card, you can split the ranges. Even with two graphics cards, you can easily double your chances.
6. "DO NOT USE" closed-source bitcrack/vanitysearch app. Use only the one in the original repo or a open sourced bitcrack application. Make sure you're really working for yourself or someone else.

## When found?

`untrusted_computer=false` If the private key is found, it will appear on the console screen. Also, a new text file will be created in the folder where the application is run. (in the name of the target wallet address.)

`untrusted_computer=true` If the private key is found, it will send your Telegram channel/group only.

**[NOTE]** =>  `force_continue=true` and `untrusted_computer=true` and if Telegram and APi share feature is turned off, <ins>you will never get the key!</ins> Use the force_continue feature with caution and do not use it if you are not sure what it does.

# Create your Docker image

You can easily create your own image with the [Dockerfile](./Docker/Dockerfile) Docker image in the repo. With the Docker image, Bitcrackrandomiser, Bitcrack and VanitySearch will be pulled and built from the original github repos.
